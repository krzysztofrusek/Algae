Aggregated Linear Gaussian State Space Models

This repository contains experimental research code for Linear Gaussian State Space Model estimation from time series at different aggregation level.
Below one can see  what happenes to the AR coefficient posterior estimated from 5 samples when additional 5 4-aggregated samples were used in the model.
